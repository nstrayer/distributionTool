<h1> Normal Distribution </h1>
<hr>

<h4>Form:</h4>
<p>$$p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-(x-\mu)^2 / 2 \sigma^2}$$</p>
<p>$\mu$ represents the mean of the distribution and $\sigma$ the standard deviation.</p>

<h4> Standard Normal: </h4>
<p>If you set $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ you arrive at what is known as the standard normal.</p>
<p>$$p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-x^2 / 2 }$$</p>
<p>This form is useful as you can remember rules for one distribution and apply them to others by converting to standard normal
    with the tranformation $z = (x- \mu)/\sigma$.
